## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

Follow these steps carefully to set up the MentorConnect project locally.

### 1. Firebase Setup üî•

*   **Create Project**: Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
*   **Authentication**:
    *   Navigate to "Authentication" (under Build).
    *   On the "Sign-in method" tab, enable:
        *   Email/Password
        *   Google (provide a project support email).
    *   Under "Authorized domains", ensure `localhost` is listed for local development. For cloud IDEs (like Google Cloud Workstations), add the specific domain your app will be served from (e.g., `your-id.cloudworkstations.dev`).
*   **Firestore Database**:
    *   Navigate to "Firestore Database" (under Build).
    *   Click "Create database".
    *   Start in **Test mode** for initial development.
        *   **üö® IMPORTANT**: For production, you **MUST** configure [Firestore Security Rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/get-started) to protect your data.
    *   Choose a Firestore location.
*   **Project Settings (Web App Config)**:
    *   Go to "Project settings" (gear icon next to "Project Overview").
    *   Under the "General" tab, find your "Web app" configuration. If one doesn't exist, click "Add app" and choose the web platform (`</>`).
    *   Copy the Firebase SDK configuration snippet values. You'll need these for the `.env.local` file.
*   **Required Indexes**:
    *   Some queries in the application (e.g., fetching posts by tag and ordering by date, fetching chats) may require composite indexes in Firestore.
    *   If you encounter errors in your server logs or browser console mentioning missing indexes, Firestore will typically provide a direct link to create the required index. Click that link and create the index.
    *   Common indexes needed:
        *   Collection: `posts`, Fields: `tags` (Array Contains) ASC, `createdAt` DESC
        *   Collection: `chats`, Fields: `participantIds` (Array Contains) ASC, `lastMessageAt` DESC

### 2. Cloudinary Setup ‚òÅÔ∏è

*   Create a Cloudinary account at [https://cloudinary.com/](https://cloudinary.com/).
*   Navigate to your Dashboard to find your `Cloud Name`, `API Key`, and `API Secret`.

### 3. Genkit AI Setup (Google AI) ü§ñ

*   Ensure you have a Google Cloud Project.
*   Enable the "Vertex AI API" or the "Generative Language API" (for Gemini models) in your Google Cloud Console for the project associated with your `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.
*   Set up authentication for your Google Cloud account locally (e.g., by running `gcloud auth application-default login`). This allows Genkit to use your credentials.
*   Obtain your Google API Key for the project. This key will be used for the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable.

### 4. Environment Variables üîë

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials and configuration.

```env
# Firebase Configuration (from your Firebase project settings)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_firebase_storage_bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_firebase_messaging_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_firebase_measurement_id # Optional

# Cloudinary Configuration
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret

# Genkit / Google AI Configuration
# API key for your Google Cloud project with Gemini models & relevant APIs enabled.
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_for_gemini
```

**Note**: `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is used by Genkit. Ensure this key is for a Google Cloud project where the necessary AI APIs (like Vertex AI or Generative Language API for Gemini) are enabled.

### 5. Install Dependencies üì¶

Open your terminal in the project root and run:

```bash
npm install
# or
# yarn install
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Project

You need to run **two separate development servers** concurrently:
1.  The Next.js application server.
2.  The Genkit AI flows server.

### Terminal 1: Start the Next.js App

```bash
npm run dev
```
This will typically start the Next.js app on `http://localhost:9002` (or another port if 9002 is busy).

### Terminal 2: Start the Genkit Development Server

```bash
npm run genkit:dev
# OR for watching changes in AI flows:
# npm run genkit:watch
```
This will start the Genkit development flow server, usually on `http://localhost:3400`. This server hosts your AI flows and makes them available for the Next.js app to call.

Now, you can access the MentorConnect application in your browser at the URL provided by the Next.js development server (e.g., `http://localhost:9002`).

---

## üöÄ Building for Production

1.  **Build the Next.js Application**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command prepares your Next.js app for production.

2.  **Start the Production Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    This command runs the optimized production build of your Next.js app.

**Note on Genkit in Production**:
For deploying Genkit flows to production, you'd typically deploy them to a cloud environment (e.g., Google Cloud Functions, Cloud Run). The `genkit:dev` server is for local development only. Refer to the [Genkit documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit) for production deployment strategies.
